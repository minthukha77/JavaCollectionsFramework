Methods of Set

        The Set interface includes all the methods of the Collection interface. 
        It's because Collection is a super interface of Set.

        Some of the commonly used methods of the Collection interface that's also available
        in the Set interface are:

    add() - adds the specified element to the set
    addAll() - adds all the elements of the specified collection to the set
    iterator() - returns an iterator that can be used to access elements of the set sequentially
    remove() - removes the specified element from the set
    removeAll() - removes all the elements from the set that is present in another specified set
    retainAll() - retains all the elements in the set that are also present in another specified set
    clear() - removes all the elements from the set
    size() - returns the length (number of elements) of the set
    toArray() - returns an array containing all the elements of the set
    contains() - returns true if the set contains the specified element
    containsAll() - returns true if the set contains all the elements of the specified collection
    hashCode() - returns a hash code value (address of the element in the set)


    1.In Java, HashSet is commonly used if we have to access elements randomly. 
       It is because elements in a hash table are accessed using hash codes.

    The hashcode of an element is a unique identity that helps to identify the element 
    in a hash table.
